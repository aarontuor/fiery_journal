cumprr_oct_jun_30m, Potential Relative Radiation (PRR) is a unitless index of available solar radiation for photosynthetic activity at a given location. PRR was calculated as described by Pierce et al. (2005) by summing digital hillshade Pierce et al. 2005. A simple method for estimating potential relative radiation (PRR) for landscape-scale vegetation analysis. Landscape Ecology 20, 137-147.interpolations for a given period of interest. Hourly hillshade interpolations are performed for daylight hours of the day of each month that most closely represents the average solar period for the month (e.g.; PRR = Sum[Hillshadei-j; m-n]; hours i-j for each representative day of months m-n). PRR in this study is based on solar conditions between October 2014 and June 2015.

zmaxyr_dndvi_30m, MODIS delta NDVI from long-term median peak NDVI in year of peak cumulative winter precipitation (see ltmed_wppt for description of cumulative winter precipitation). Long-term median peak NDVI is based on eMODIS peak NDVI for 2001-2014. Year of peak cumulative winter precipitation was determined by calculating an annual Z-score for the corresponding period of record on a multi-temporal pixel basis. The long-term mean and standard deviation values used in the Z-score calculation are based on winter precipitation from 1980-2015. Selection of the year of peak winter precipitation was limited to 2001-2014 to be consistent with NDVI period of record.
